**Few-shot learning for water ingression detection in aircraft rudder hoisting points using infrared thermography**

*NDT Engineering to Data Science portfolio - Few-shot learning with thermal physics integration*

## Project Overview

This project develops deep learning models for automated water ingression detection in aircraft rudder hoisting points using infrared thermography (IRT). Building upon the complete NDT methodology portfolio (Hub Inspection, Flap Analytics, X-ray CNN, HR Analytics), this project demonstrates few-shot learning implementation for data-scarce aviation environments while integrating thermal physics principles with computer vision.

**Achievement: 100% accuracy in validation testing using prototypical networks with multi-modal thermal data fusion**

## Business Problem

Aircraft rudder hoisting point inspections are extremely rare but safety-critical operations. Water ingression in these structural components can lead to catastrophic failure during flight operations. Traditional inspection relies entirely on expert visual interpretation of thermal images, creating bottlenecks and potential for human error. The rarity of these inspections (82 images over 2+ years) makes traditional machine learning approaches impractical.
